       <li id="fees-list"> Embedded electric wheel for assisted mobility in bicycles: This project consists of designing, developing, fabricating and testing of an embedded wheel drive with electric motor of 500W rating. The wheel drive can be retrofitted to be used in all types of cycles. Work done in last month: the lamination alignment in 120 degree Phase shift, winding of the coils and testing, increase of torque
            by modifying the Vissim program parameters.</li> <br>
       <li id="fees-list"> Solar energy module with LED drive and USB charging:This project consists of designing, developing, fabricating and testing of an embedded Solar energy module with an LED drive of 10V and a USB charging port of 5V. Work done in last month: drawing of the schematics of the circuit, designing the modules of the circui
           t board, rooting for the circuit board. </li> <br>
       <li id="fees-list">Cost effective Bamboo Bicycle for the purpose: The project consists of designing, developing, fabricating and testing of bicycle made up of bamboo frame with a new innovative design and structure. This project is a proof of concept and 
           will later be integrated with the e-bike motor. </li> <br>
       <li id="fees-list"> Induction motor control: The project entails designing,developing and testing of an induction motor control with the power boards V5C-R-V5A and V5C-R-V5B. The project consists of automatic speed control of induction motor using Vissim software and also implements the Vissim program into the standard industrial form of command-generique-4

       <li id="fees-list">Meta Language: Metalanguage is the user friendly IDE for users who has less knowledge in C programming and wants to develop prototypes using certain hardware. It is written in C code and its user friendly IDE helps to user to write the programs at ease. Using Metalanguage, it is possible to read and write a GPIO and interfacing it to a sensor to do a lot of interesting things. Right now, Metalanguage is developed for TMS320F2808 and many hardware micro 
           processors will be includes in future. </li> <br>
       <li id="fees-list"> Energy efficient motor controller using MSP430F5529:Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are electronically commutated motors that offer many advantages over brushed DC motors and therefore are becoming very popular industrially and commercially. This project report discusses a sensored 3-phase BLDC motor control solution using MSP430F5529 as the motor controller. Hall sensors are used to detect the rotor position and close the commutation loop. Both open loop and closed-loop control implementations are discussed. This project is conducted as an experiment for replacing the TMS320 processor in V5C-R-V5 board which is a patented power 
           inverter board of FranceCol Technology. </li> <br>
